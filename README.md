# DataScience_TermProject
The codes in this folder are the ones we have used for our Data Science project- Climate Analogs.
The codes here are mainly for the Data Visualization which is done for the results obtained.
The Data Visualization is in form of network maps depicting how counties move and violin plots that show how counties move in terms of climate.
There is another code which is for the webpage cum dashboard that has been created for the project.
